<details><summary> UCS016 (ENGINEERING DESIGN PROJECT-I) </summary><blockquote>
 <details><summary> Course Objectives </summary><blockquote>
 To develop design skills according to a Conceive-Design-Implement Operate (CDIO) compliant methodology. To apply engineering sciences through learning-by doing project work. To provide a framework to encourage creativity and innovation. To <br>develop team work and communication skills through group-based activity. To foster self directed learning and critical evaluation.<br>To provide a basis for the technical aspects of the project a small number of lectures are <br>incorporated into the module. As the students would have received little in the way of formal <br>engineering instruction at this early stage in the degree course, the level of the lectures is to be <br>introductory with an emphasis on the physical aspects of the subject matter as applied to the <br>‘Mangonel’ project. The lecture series include subject areas such as Materials, Structures, <br>Dynamics and Digital Electronics delivered by experts in the field.<br>This module is delivered using a combination of introductory lectures and participation by the <br>students in 15 “activities”. The activities are executed to support the syllabus of the course and <br>might take place in specialised laboratories or on the open ground used for firing the Mangonel. <br>Students work in groups throughout the semester to encourage teamwork, cooperation and to <br>avail of the different skills of its members. In the end the students work in sub-groups to do the <br>Mangonel throwing arm redesign project. They assemble and operate a Mangonel, based on <br>the lectures and tutorials assignments of mechanical engineering they experiment with the <br>working, critically analyse the effect of design changes and implement the final project in a <br>competition. Presentation of the group assembly, redesign and individual reflection of the <br>project is assessed in the end.
